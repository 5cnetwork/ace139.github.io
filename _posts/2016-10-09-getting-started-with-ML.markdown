## What is Machine Learning ?
Machine Learning is a sub-domain of Artificial Intelligence where a machine(more like a program running on the machine) is made to learn facts from data fed into it.

To get a better understanding of it, consider an infant baby. First the baby is shown a dog, what the baby does is, it immediately tries to collect features of the dog, like color of the fur, a tail, four legs, more of a description. Now if the baby comes across any animal, it tires to match the features of that animal with the dog previously shown. Now suppose, the baby sees a cow, because of the features like four legs, a tail, coincidentally the same color of fur as of dog, it makes a mistake to identify it as another dog. Then the parents tries to point out to a few more features like, there is a huge difference of size between a dog and a cow, continues with cows having horns and dogs lacking it, and other differences such as a bark and a moo sounds different. Like this the baby understands that dogs and cows are different. Now it sees next animal and the process goes on, until the baby becomes intelligent in differentiation different animals without much help of parents.

Now what Machine Learning does is tries to reproduce the phenomenon in a computer program where the computer is not explicitly programmed to differentiate between a dog and a cow, but like the baby tries to find differences from the data fed into it. In the manner the baby tries to extract features from the data so that it could differentiate between dogs and cows, the machine learning algorithm also tends to do the same to classify the data in two different categories of dogs and cows, or any two different elements likewise.

Now whatever I have tried to explain with the example is tip of the iceberg, Machine Learning is having a greater span and could be used in numerous different applications. But I hope I was able to give an essence of it from the example above.
