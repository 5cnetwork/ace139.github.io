## Installation
If you have already installed Anaconda Python Distribution, then you don't have to worry at all. You already have got NumPy. If you are not using Anaconda, you need to do it by using pip

{% highlight bash %}
$ pip install numpy
{% endhighlight %}

## What is NumPy ?

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

## Learning NumPy:

NumPy is gonna be a very important aspect in Data Science using Python. To be honest, the NumPy official tutorial is the best for getting started. Writing the same thing twice is absolutely unnecessary, hence I am not going over it. The guide is very precise and well written with proper examples for implementation. You need to be familiar with the NumPy functions, as it will be used very frequently while working with Data. Down below is the link to the NumPy Official Tutorial.

Happy Learning. God Speed!
