## What is this project? Why is it important?

In the last couple of decades there has been a steep rise in environmental degradation. With the increasing need of energy, all the environmental resources are getting depleted. This non-sustainable development came with a high price to pay, all of the mankind is paying it by contaminating the vital resources like Water, Air and Soil.
This project is intended to monitor the contamination levels in Air, which is one of the primary requirement to sustain life. It will enable us to quantify the level of air quality throughout the city, which in-turn will enable us to identify the sources for the high contamination region and hence the government and people could take appropriate measures to control the condition. The government of India has taken initiatives to build smart cities around the country, which brings a great opportunity to be able to monitor the Air Quality of the Cities.

## What is being built in this project ?

This project aims to build a prototype of a complete **Air Quality Monitoring System** for a City. We are building small and portable **Air Quality Monitoring Units**, of size a bit bigger than briefcases. The AQM Units we are building are very cheap in comparison to the huge AQM Stations placed in many places around the globe. It takes **millions of USD** to set up a AQM Station whereas our units costs less than **50,000 INR**. The AQM stations have faced challenges to be able to detect the minute changes varying from region to region in a City. Due to it's high cost, it is not possible to build multiple stations in a city. Our efforts will overcome this anomaly to be able to project fine grained air quality throughout the City. In a developing country like India, minimization of the cost is of great importance. These units are equipped with multiple toxic gas sensors like **Oxides of Sulfur**, **Oxides of Nitrogen**, **Carbon Monoxide**, **Ozone** and also sensors for **particulate matters**(dust particles to be blunt) of different sizes like **PM10**, **PM2.5** and **PM1**. These units also measures the **Temperature** and **Humidity**. All these sensors are being controlled by using **Micro-controllers and Micro-computers**. These units measures the pollutants in the Air and transmits the real-time data to a remote server using Internet Connectivity. The servers are processing the data and generating results indicating the Air Quality. Along with this, taking one more step forward, **Android application** has been developed showing the Air Quality of the regions in a map. This applications will be made available to the general public soon, so that they have a clear and transparent picture of the air they breath in and take necessary steps to control air quality if and when needed. The Air Quality affects the human health to a great extent. It is the right of all people to know the conditions of their surroundings and safeguard themselves from direct impact on their health.


## What do I do in the Project?

Because the air quality is always non-uniform in City regions, therefore it is very challenging to decide the placement of these Air Quality Monitoring Units. Challenge is to place the Air Quality Monitoring units optimally without compromising the detection of changes in the Air Quality in different regions in the city. My role in the Project is using **Data Science and Machine Learning algorithms** to process the data coming from the AQM Units and predict the uneven changes in the region and identify the most suitable location to deploy the Air Quality Monitoring Units to get a fine grained Air Quality Map for the whole city.
