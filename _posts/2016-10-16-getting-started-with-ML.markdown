# Machine Learning

Surely you have been hearing the above term quite a lot for the past couple of years, specially the time I am writing this blog post. So what is it and why it is in hype?

Knowingly or unknowingly we use machine learning everyday, better to say all the time. I can say this because we are using Search Engine like Google Search all the time. You must have noticed while searching for some information in Google Search, you get lots of suggestion before ending your query, and I won't be very wrong if I say most of the time you see what you are looking for in those suggestions. That is the result of Machine Learning, where the machine have learnt the search pattern for millions and billions of searches it goes through everyday all over the globe and comes up with meaningful suggestions. Not only these, you might have seen how Facebook identifies your picture and also your friend's picture from a group photo and automatically tags them. It is also the work of Machine Learning. You might also have noticed that if you are searching for something to buy in e-commerce sites like Amazon, after closing the search and browsing different web pages, you still will get the advertisements of similar product in the web-page you are viewing, you guessed it right, the reason why it happens ;). Now coming to more serious stuffs, study of human brain(Neural Network), medication(drugs), predicting environmental degradation, prediction of stock market prices, self-driving cars, robots, business strategy modeling, and whatever field you can think of, Machine Learning is or can be used to improvisation or betterment. I think you already are feeling amazing to know the endless scope of it.

Let's take a look into it more technically. ML is said to be a science that enables a computer(machine) the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

A more formal definition would be: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

You must have played or seen someone play a game of chess with the computer program. To relate to the above definition,

* E = The experience of playing many games of chess

* T = The task of playing chess

* P = The chance that computer program will win the game.

As you can sense till now, Machine Learning is a very vast subject but broadly can be divided into two branches **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Learning**. We will see it in depth in the coming blog post. 

Stay tuned and Keep Learning.

Godspeed!
