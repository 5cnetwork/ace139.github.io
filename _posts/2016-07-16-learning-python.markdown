## Where to start learning Python ?

You made a good choice by choosing Python as your primary language for Data Science and Machine Learning. But if you haven't made the choice to use Python for the purpose, still it's a very awesome language to learn. It makes your life very easy.

**Resources** :

> All the resources I am quoting is for **Python 3.x**. I would really suggest you, that if you are learning it go for Python 3.x rather than 2.x

* This [e-book](http://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is to the point and no bullshit guide for getting you up and running. The primary author of the book is [**Kushal Das**](https://twitter.com/kushaldas), member of the Board of Directors, Python Software Foundation. I myself began my journey of Python from here.

* You can also join the Summer Training of Durgapur Linux User Group (#dgplug) headed by **Kushal Das**, they cover Python in depth. And if you have interest in **Open Source** Development and Contribution, you can not ask for anything better. In the training program, you will also be introduced to several tools for building your own project top to bottom. Definitely worth a try. It takes place in IRC and completely free. I cannot think of any better place for a beginner to start. I am proud to be a part of the community. Click [here](https://dgplug.org/) for details.

* If you are a video tutorial person, you will love [this](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-to-python-programming/). These videos are very precise and touches parts of the language you should get yourself familiarize to.

* Though the web is full of resources I always like to keep a printed book for reference. If you are really serious about Python, maybe you should keep one too. I am really fond of **Mark Lutz** for the book **Learning Python**. You can buy the book from any e-commerce sites.

Hope the post was helpful. For more information you can always ask.

Happy Learning !
